## Limitations

AuroWallet is only used for sending transactions, not for deploying the contract and signing

Account creation fee cannot be paid by the contract at the moment due to a bug in snarkyjs 

Altought everything is in web-workers, everything works using signatures as of now

Off-chain storage hasnÂ´t been implemented yet
